Selenium class 3

Why do we need Xpath and CSS Selector?
-- developers will not provide all the locators in html
-- by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is Xpath?
-- xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the webpage.

Types of Xpath:

--Absolute xpath--> start from the starting node in html, always starts with the single (/)
            e.g /html/body/div/div/div
-- Relative Xpath--> starts from any node in the HTML
             always starts with (//)
Syntax Relative xPath:
//tag-name[@attribute = 'attribute value']
Example: //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

Examples:
//a[text() = 'Create new account']
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

Identifying elements by using contains method
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute vale')]

example on partial link:
//input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]

Starts-with() will identify the element with partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value']
//button[starts-with(@data-testid,'royal')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.o and this method is not available

<div> -- division
<img> -- image
<h> -- header
<p> --paragraph
<li> -- list
<ul> -- unordered list
<ol>-- ordered list

Advanced Xpath
is based on parent and child, sibling relationships
identifying elements by following sibling
//tagname[@attribut ='attribute value;]/following-sibling::tagname

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img
//span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span goes back

identifying elements by parent
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parent Tagname
//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying an element by its ancestors
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestor tagname

identifying element by index
(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
