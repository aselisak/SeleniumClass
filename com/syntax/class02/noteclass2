Selenium Class 2

What is WebElement?
anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webElement
- buttons
- checkbox
- textBoxes
- links

HTML?
HyperText MarkUp Language

What is DOM
DOM stands for Document Object Model. IT is the browser's internal view  of the webpage
Also called as Developer's tools or Dev tools
Document--> can be stored any document such as pdf, excel...
Object--> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Module --? it is a layout of the HTML

Locator:
is an address or position of an webelement on the web page
is used to locate or identity webelements on the web page
8 locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkTest
- CSS Selector
-- Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
purple  -- tags || button, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue -- attribute value

Why do we need many locators:
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for e.g LinkText and PartialLinkText are only used for links
"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes values selenium will only interact with first element it locates
