Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2. Javascript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                    we cannot inspect
3. windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1. simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept(); -> click ok
2. dismiss(); -> click to cancel
3. getText()->
4. sendKeys() -

To handle authentication alert we need to pass username and password in the URl
"https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth"
      //username:password@

Frames
Frame is a seperate independent window in our webpage
frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page
3 wats ti interact with Frames:
1.by index
2. by name or ID
3. WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to main page

How do you handle alerts in selenium:
we handle alerts by using Alert interface
